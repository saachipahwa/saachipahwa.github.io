# Chris

The main focus was implementing [user nudging](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/140).
This feature allows users to nudge other users in their network by setting them a
step goal. The receiver will get a notification and will be able to track their
progress. The reciever *and* sender will get a notification when the goal is met,
which provides some sort of accountability (you are motivated to walk since the
original sender will find out, when you have done so).

I also fixed some issue with sending network add links through SMS, and improve
performance using lazy loading of contact images.
