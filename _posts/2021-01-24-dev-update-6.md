## Bug fix for Android 10 devices

Due to some [changes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes#physical-activity-recognition)
with Android 10+ devices that aim to improve privacy, the step counter is not 
accessible by default, one must request permissions manually. (We only
discovered this later since we didn't have an Android 10 device to test.)

The solution was to target a lower Android API version, which means the system
will auto-grant you permission (to improve backwards compatibility), this is
also suitable since we don't depend on any modern Android API features.

## Widget Testing for Wellbeing Check screen

The wellbeing check screen inserts their wellbeing data into the DB, so we
definitely wanted to test this. To do this we used [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito)
and [clock](https://pub.dev/packages/clock). Mockito was needed to mock our DB
class and we used clock to also mock (or 'fake' as clock calls it) the time
so the tests wouldn't be dependent on the time we ran it.

## Wellbeing Sharing Development Started

The last big feature we aim to work on is the ability to share your wellbeing
data (as a graph) with a friend directly in the app. The back-end API needed
for this is essentially [complete](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973/team26-goviz/pull/5). 
It uses a simple relational database for users and 'unread messages' (which is 
just the unread data).

## Next Steps

- Continue with the Wellbeing Sharing feature
- Add widget tests to another screen
