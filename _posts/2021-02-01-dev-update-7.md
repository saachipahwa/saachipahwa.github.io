# Chris

[Wellbeing sharing](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/82) 
is now feature complete.
You can:
- Add friends with QR codes.
- Send wellbeing graphs to them directly.
- Receive notifications when a user sends a graph (within 15 mins.)

This also comes with some nice UX additions like pull to refresh and
unread notifications indicator.

All this is done securely and privately using E2E RSA encryption, password authorization
(using bcrypt) and HTTPS for transmission.

I've also [began adding](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973/team26-goviz/pull/6) 
API tests for the back-end since this feature required a couple 
new endpoints and a relational database to be added.

## Next Steps

- Finish back-end testing.
- Add more tests to the mobile client.
