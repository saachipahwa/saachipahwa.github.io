Aside from the elevator pitch, the main thing I worked on was developing an
[alternate step counter](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973/flutter-plugins) 
for Android devices which do not have one.

This was achieved by forking an existing open source flutter package and
extending it significantly to provide an alternative step counter that
uses the device's linear accelerometer sensor. I've based the algorithm
off the one [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1554233.1554235).

It has to be 'turned on', unlike dedicated step counters since
Android's dedicated step counters are active in the background.
My implementation uses an Android service that listens to the accelerometer
and performs some digital signal processing on the sensor data to try and
count steps.

- Add Widget Testing (And Unit Testing if appropriate)
- In-app Wellbeing Sharing
