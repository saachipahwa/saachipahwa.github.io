## Share Button for Wellbeing Graph & Wellbeing Check

[Here's the PR.](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/39)
Added a share button to any wellbeing graph that converts that graph widget
into a PNG using `RenderRepaintBoundary`' then adds this to a new PDF that
can be shared through the native mobile share screen.

Also adds two automated nudging systems:
- After every checkup, checks if this is the second time in a row
a score has dropped.
- Background process (using [Workmanager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager))
that monitors pedometer and nudges if steps haven't increased for approximately
48 hours.

## New MySql DB & Back-end Rewrite

Upon discussion with the client, we decided it best to create a new database
to work from so I defined an updated schema for the database and added it
to MySQL through the Linode server.

I also thought that the previous node.js codebase was unnecessarily bloated
so I rewrote nearly the entire codebase and achieved the same functionality
in under 200 lines of Go (as well as some HTML + JS).

## Next Steps

- Review & Polish Mobile Client
- Begin prototype of p2p nudges
- Improve UI of Back-end viz
