My main focus this time was improving the usability of adding people in the app.
Although, QR codes may be sufficient in person, they become inconvenient when
adding someone remotely (even when the ability to export the QR code as an image
is provided.)

Therefore, my [solution](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team26/pull/118) 
was to provide sharable deep links that the user can send to their friends, so they can add them.
The friend clicks the link, and then clicks a second link in the web browser (with the app installed)
to be taken directly to the add friends page in the app.

[Here](https://www.figma.com/proto/nZUDNKJuf0hcUDXRUVGJOD/Add-With-URL?node-id=0%3A3&scaling=scale-down)
is a Figma to demonstrate this.

## Next Steps

- Further improve the usability/UI on client feedback.
- Continue adding tests and testing.
- Improve state management with Provider.
- Maybe polish UI: add highlighted tab, improve graph interaction, etc.?
